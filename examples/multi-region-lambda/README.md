# About

The SNS registration system solves the problem of what (stacks) are running where (which AWS accounts), and what their current status (version, updates, etc) are.

Useful for:
- Enterprise Account management
- Managed Service Providers
- Account based deployed utilities

# Running SSIS

We follow the `cake` approach, lightweight `mmake` ([modern make](https://github.com/tj/mmake)) based CloudFormation deployment and management.
